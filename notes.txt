-code that is sent to arduino is sent serially (tx for laptop and rx for arduino)

-the usb type A contains 4 wires tx for laptop , rx for arduino, 5v for power to arduino and GND also for power

-there is also parallel communication where all bits go travel at the same time

-the transfer speed / communication speed is in baud rate (bps)

-we called serial library and used begin functin with the baudrate

-then we do serial.println("whatever")

-because arduino is transmitting data that is why tx LED is on (its actually blinking at the baud rate which is 9600)

-shorter leg of LED is anode, longer leg is cathode

-there are 4 types of functions in arduino

-digitalread sends 0 or 1

-sensors compatible with arduino have 3 pins (VCC, DATA, GND) {the distance this sensor can read is from 2cm to 4 metre} [model -> HC-SR04]
	->the trigger pin will be given high
	->the echo pin (initially low) will be used as an input for arduino (high for when it recieves the sound wave)

-if we give Ultrasonic sensor high for 10 micro secs then there will be 8 pulses at 40khz.

-the time which we will recieve from sensor will be in microsecond

-we add a delay to actually register the distance because the response would be too fast otherwise

-always give time to the sensor to settle by setting it to low for a second or two

-we can dim or brighten an LED by PWM (pulse width modulation)

-duty cycle = (time on / time on  + time off) * 100 (%)

-by changing the duty cycle of the pulses we can dim or brighten the LED

-duty cycle range is 0 to 255 where 255 corresponds to 100% of the duty cycle

-this brightning and dimming only works with pins having ~ symbol (i.e. 3,5,6,9,10,11)

-DC motor working voltage range 3 to 9 volts

-servo rotates from 0 to 180 degrees , its very precise

-red connects to VCC 5V, brown connects to ground, yellow connects to any pwm enabled pin

-the LDR is a simple bare sensor, hence it only gives us analog values

-Light Dependent Resistor , resistance varies depending on light incident on it

-we convert the LDR's analog values into digital values via an ADC 

-the ADC range of arduino is 10bit (0 to 1023) these correspond to the voltage

>>autobrightness how to with the arduino

>>read about the l293D motor driver READ ABOUT THIS AND COME PREPARED TOMORROW 
======================================================================================
DAY 2

-we begin by movin motor forward

-stop left motor to go left & right motor to go right

-if we want to give more power to the motor we can use L293D

-L293D is controlled via
